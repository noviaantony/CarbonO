##  Our Solution
CarbonO is an application whereby users can claim e-credits when they consume foods with lower carbon footprints. User can browse a page of dishes and compare the carbon emissions of the various dishes through their "carbon rating" (based on Eaternity: https://eaternity.org/). Users can scan QR codes from a receipt for a dish (from the dishes mentioned in our application) and claim "e-credits". When a dish has a higher carbon-rating (dishes with lower carbon footprint) , users can claim more e-credits for that dish. Lastly, users can convieniently use accumulated e-credits to claim rewards or donate to organizations fighting climate change!

## Core Features

***Carbon Footprint Tracker***
> Search from a list of recipes and view their corresponding carbon-emission rating (based on Eaternity)
> Scan QR code on receipt and claim e-credits (the lower the carbon-emission rating of a dish, the more e-credits you can collect!)

***Rewards***
> Users can use e-credits to claim rewards from sustainable brands working towards climate change

***Donation***
> Users can use e-credits to donate to their desired organisation that is fighting climate change
> User can choose to donate to organisations using their credit cards as well

***Dashboard***
> View historical qr scans, totals e-credits, total carbon emissions from food
> Users can easily visualize their carbon emission and summary of data uploaded in the form of pie chart & line graphs
> View historical reward claims and donations made
